        <h2>The Real Chicago Deep-Dish Pizza Dough?</h2>
        <p>
            I've never been to Chicago, but I've tried one in a local pizzeria.
            Me and my kids liked it very much.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li>
                1 1/8 cups warm water - 110 to 115 degrees F (43 to 45 degrees
                C)
            </li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup corn oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>butter as needed, for greasing</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a bowl. Let stand
                until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, 5 to 10
                minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine yeast mixture, flour, corn oil, and kosher salt in a
                large stand mixer fitted with the dough hook; knead until dough
                holds together but is still slightly sticky, about 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Form dough into a ball and transfer to a buttered bowl. Turn to
                coat dough with butter, then cover the bowl with a towel and let
                rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 6 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Punch down dough and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Press dough
                into a 10-inch deep-dish pizza pan and follow your pizza recipe.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add cheese, toppings, and tomatoes that you've flavored with
                garlic, basil, oregano, etc. Bake the pizza in an oven preheated
                to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for about 30 minutes, depending
                on your oven. You can prebake the crust for 10-15 minutes before
                adding toppings if desired.
